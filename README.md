#### In a nutshell.

Think of it as a complete replacement to both Express.js and Socket.IO, written entirely in C/C++ for maximum performance and reliability. There are tons of [examples](examples) but here's the gist of it all:

```javascript
/* Non-SSL is simply App() */
require('uWebSockets.js').SSLApp({

  /* There are tons of SSL options */
  key_file_name: 'misc/key.pem',
  cert_file_name: 'misc/cert.pem',
  
}).ws('/*', {

  /* For brevity we skip the other events */
  message: (ws, message, isBinary) => {
    let ok = ws.send(message, isBinary);
  }
  
}).any('/*', (res, req) => {

  /* Let's deny all Http */
  res.end('Nothing to see here!');
  
}).listen(9001, (listenSocket) => {

  if (listenSocket) {
    console.log('Listening to port 9001');
  }
  
});
```

#### Ready all thrusters.

Install with `npm install uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#v17.1.0` or any such [release](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js/releases). No compiler needed.
